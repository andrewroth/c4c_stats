DB Mappings
===========

Allows you to define your database structure in a mappings.yml file.

Useful for working with legacy databases, and for deploying the same code on multiple database schemas.

Usage
======

Create a mappings.yml file in your config folder. A sample can be found included with this plugin.
Follow the format in the sample.

In each class that requires custom mapping, add the line 

  load_mappings
  
just after the class declaration
